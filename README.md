# My solutions to Advent Of Code 2020

I accidentally ran `rm -rf *` in `/home/markus` after solving 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2. I managed to stop it before it ruined too much, but the `adventofcode` directory was deleted… I'll add them back if I manage to recover the files.

Just wanted to put this up on Github in case I run `rm -rf *` in `/home/markus` again.
