# My solutions to Advent Of Code 2020

I accidentally ran `rm -rf *` in `/home/markus` after solving 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2. I managed to stop it before it ruined too much, but the `adventofcode` directory was deletedâ€¦ I'll add them back if I manage to recover the files.

Just wanted to put this up on Github in case I run `rm -rf *` in `/home/markus` again.

## Commands

### Compile and run all solutions

`yarn start`

### Start compilation watch

`yarn watch`

### Test a single solution

Here, we are testing 4-2:

`yarn test 4-2`
